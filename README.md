# CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION 
Churn prediction means detecting which customers are likely to leave a service or to cancel a subscription to a service. 
Understanding what keeps customers engaged is extremely valuable knowledge, as it can help you to develop your retention strategies, and to roll out operational practices aimed at keeping customers from walking out the door.
Different customers exhibit different behaviours and preferences, so they cancel their subscriptions for various reasons. It is critical, therefore, to proactively communicate with each of them in order to retain them in your customer list.
